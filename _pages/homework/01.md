    1\. Setup a GitHub account. We went over this in class and here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVRuPO8nCLA) refresher.

    2\. Setup a GitHub organization for keeping your class project files. Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnFm5fYGzso) showing how to do it.

    3\. Use the [HW01 template](https://github.com/DM-GY-6063-2023F-D/p5js-template) to start a repository in your organization's GitHub account. It should be named HW01. Open the notebook file in google colab to continue with the exercises. These [notes](https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb) should help.

    4\. Complete as many of the exercises in the notebook. Make sure to keep the notebook synchronized with your github repo.
