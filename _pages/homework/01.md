    This assignment is to guarantee that we all have our tools and accounts setup for the rest of the course. There are 3 mandatory tasks that should be complete and 1 optional task:

    1a. Setup a GitHub account. We went over this in class and here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVRuPO8nCLA) refresher. Once you have an account, submit your username or profile link via Brightspace. (2 points)

    1b. (Optional) Setup a GitHub organization for keeping your class project files. This is optional, but will help. Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnFm5fYGzso) showing how to do it. Submit your organization name or profile link via Brightspace. (2 points)

    2\. Setup your local development environment with VSCode and its plugins (or another IDE) and the GitHub Desktop App. Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN5A0kDdCwk) showing how to setup the GitHub Desktop App. Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlyQ9GR1LBM) that shows how to install plugins in VSCode. We should have these installed: [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer), [p5js Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=acidic9.p5js-snippets), [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode). Let me know which IDE you're using and if you are using the GitHub Desktop App (or another git client) via your submission on Brightspace. (5 points)

    3\. Start a repository from the [class template](https://github.com/DM-GY-6063-2023F-D/p5js-template) in your personal or organization GitHub account. It should be named HW01. Enable GitHub pages to make your project go "live". Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDNc-epGz58) showing how to do this. Submit the link to this repo via Brightspace. (3 points)

    Please submit your answers via [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/312200).
